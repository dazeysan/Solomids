# How to use the playable version
- Starting a new game:
  - When the page first loads it will select a random numerical seed to use for the setup.
  - Click "Random Game" to generate a different random seed.
  - Enter your own seed in to the box at the top center and click "Seeded Game" to use that text as the seed.
- Customize the look:
  - Click the "Settings" button in the upper-right to open and close the settings.
  - Change the color of the pyramids, board, and cell highlight via the drop-down boxes.
  - When choosing "Custom", one or more color-picker fields will appear to let you customize each color.
  - The checkboxes under the pyramid color picker fields will change the border and pip color from black to white.
  - Your choices here will be saved to the local storage of the browser and be used the next time you load the page.
- Sharing a game with others:
  - You can take a "screenshot" of the board at any time by clicking the "Download Image of the current board" button at the bottom-left.  This will download an image named "seed".png
  - Clicking the "History" button will show/hide the History box.
  - The text field in the history box will contain a sharable string of text containing the moves you have made this game.
  - The "Copy" button will copy the sharable string to the clipboard.
  - To show others how you solved a particular seed, you can copy this text and paste it in a forum or message to them.
- Viewing a shared game:
  - Copy the text that someone has shared and paste it in to the text field.
  - Click the "Load" button.
  - The History box will now be replaced with the Playback box.  There are a number of buttons to control the replay and a more verbose version of the moves.
  - The square notation is the same as used in Chess.  The columns are labeled left-to-right A, B, C, D, E, the rows are labeled bottom-to-top 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, 10.  So square D2 is the 4th column from the left, 2nd square from the bottom.
  - The "Step Back" and "Step Fwd" buttons will let you step move by move through the playback.
  - The "Play", "Pause", and "Rewind" buttons control the automatic playback.
  - "1x" and "2x" control the speed of the playback.
  - "Close" will exit Playback and return you to the History box.
